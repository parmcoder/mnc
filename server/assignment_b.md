## Take-Home Assignment: Transaction Broadcasting and Monitoring Client Module

### Objective:
Your task is to develop a client module in either Go or Rust that interacts with an HTTP server. This client module will enable the broadcasting of a transaction and subsequently monitor its status until finalization.

### Requirements:
Create a client module in Go or a client crate in Rust that is designed to be integrated into another application, with the following capabilities:

1. **Broadcast Transaction**: Construct a JSON payload and send a POST request to `https://mock-node-wgqbnxruha-as.a.run.app/broadcast`. The payload structure is as follows:

    ```json
    {
        "symbol": "string",          // Transaction symbol, e.g., BTC
        "price": uint64,             // Symbol price, e.g., 100000
        "timestamp": uint64          // Timestamp of price retrieval
    }
    ```

    Example payload and server response:
    ```json
    // Payload
    {
        "symbol": "ETH",
        "price": 4500,
        "timestamp": 1678912345
    }
    
    // Server response
    {
        "tx_hash": "e97ae379d666eed7576bf285c451baf9f0edba93ce718bf15b06c8a85d07b8d1"
    }
    ```

2. **Transaction Status Monitoring**: Utilize the transaction hash obtained from the response to periodically issue GET requests to `https://mock-node-wgqbnxruha-as.a.run.app/check/<tx_hash>`. The response will be plaintext indicating the transaction status, which can be one of the following:
   - `CONFIRMED`: Transaction has been processed and confirmed
   - `FAILED`: Transaction failed to process
   - `PENDING`: Transaction is awaiting processing
   - `DNE`: Transaction does not exist

   An example response is shown below:
   ```json
   {
       "tx_status": "CONFIRMED"
   }
   ```
   
3. **Documentation**: Provide clear documentation and a example script that implements your client module. The documentation should explain how to use and integrate it, along with your strategies for handling each transaction status.

### Submission:
Choose one of the following submission methods:

1. **Zip Package**: Create a zip file containing your client module's code and the README.
2. **GitHub Repository**: Establish a GitHub repository for your client module, including both the code and README.
